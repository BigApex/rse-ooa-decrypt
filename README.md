# Respawn's Source Engine `.ooa` decrypt tool

This project was made to eliminate the need to distribute binary blobs, which might give some trouble if used in fan made projects.

## Supported versions

 * Retail Apex (`5.02.04.66`)
 * Titanfall 2 (`5.00.01.35`)


## Non-Goals

 * Make this as small of a binary as possible
   * This usually trips over most Anti-Virus solutions
